   PROJECT: Bharat Pi Ultrasonic sensor Sample Code
   AUTHOR: Bharat Pi

   DESC: This script will give you the sample testing of ultrasonic sensor,
   which will measure the distance and
   prints the distance values in cm when you run the code.
   #upload lcd library from Bharapi_lcd_display folder if you are using lcd sensor with Ultrasonic
